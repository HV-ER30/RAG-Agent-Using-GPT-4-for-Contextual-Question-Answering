# RAG-Agent-Using-GPT-4-for-Contextual-Question-Answering
This project implements a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) agent using GPT-4 to generate factually grounded answers based on retrieved documents. It ensures response accuracy through hallucination detection, relevance grading, and conditional decision-making, refining the search or retrying as needed.
